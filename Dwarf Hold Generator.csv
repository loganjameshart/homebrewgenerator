"stone dwarves! Dwarves who work with stone primarily, their skin is gray and craggy. They use chisels to shape their hair into fantastical shapes, but have normal innards. They are absurdly resistant to poison, more so than other dwarves, and there have been accounts that they eat gravel with meals to help digestion. ","in a mountain! What are you, an idiot? Of course dwarves live under the mountain, it’s their whole thing! And these dwarves, oh they know what dwarfin’ means. Beards, axes, mines, the whole deal. And don’t get them started on digging too deep and too greedily!","armor! Their armor is thick and their shields are broad, they’re the super-heavy defensive line that cavalry turns to red paste against. These dwarves don’t bother with axes or hammers, just shields for smashing and greaves for crushing. Some elf-smiths once went on about weaving stars into their mail, and these dwarves crushed it. Easily.","dwarf berserkers! These guys are absolutely mad and mad (both meanings). They drink, fight, and sleep, though rarely in that order. They keep showing up, sometimes from outside the hold, and a suspicious number of them have mohawks. Despite dying in shocking numbers, there always seem to be more of them.","the god of the forge! Doesn’t matter what name he’s got, he’s still the god of the forge. Different names and faces, but he’s always banging that hammer, that’s where earthquakes come from, since his forge is in the heart of the world. That’s why dwarves keep digging too deep, to find him and learn at his feet. Read a book!","a dwarven king! He whose fathers and their fathers fathers have long defended these halls. He carries the crown and hammer of his noble name, and often sits in the grand mausoleum, seeking counsel from the statue-cairns of his noble predecessors. For he is a dwarf, and should tidings be true, may be the last of his name.","they haven’t dug deep enough! It’s very shameful to all the dwarves within, but they just can’t manage it. They’ve hired hundreds of wizards to make illusions of the grandeur of their too deep digging, and live in terror of other dwarves realizing it. ","the hold is under assault from without! An army has assembled to siege it, and they’ve received special assistance from a druid circle to start collapsing tunnels out with tree roots. There’s all sorts of legalese in the negotiations, and the besiegers keep waving a piece of paper around, but that’s just tall-folk nonsense! The dwarves have their own paper, an old treaty with a now-defunct polity, and the tall-folk won’t accept that! Regardless, things are at a stalemate, but there are rumors that mercenaries are being called in to assault the hold, they should be here in a month. ","kids these days don’t know how good they have it! There’s a youth movement in the dwarf-hold, and it’s no good at all. They keep only doing the bare minimum (just ten hours of work a day), and are talking about horrific topics, like art and vacations. Something needs to be done to shake these young dwarves into proper dwarf-like behavior!"
"iron dwarves! Dwarves that developed a deep love of ironworking, they have a dull sheen to their skin. Their bones have metallic veins throughout, and they are extremely resistant to breaking bones, one of the reasons they love to headbutt. As they grow older, their bones start to creak, and they soothe it in bath houses with hot soaks.","in a giant, calcified tree! Few hundred years ago the dwarves cleared out whoever was living there, probably some elves or giant bugs, something that likes leaves. It’s old though, that tree, and it’s practically stone. Course you can reach the ground still through the roots, if you need that.","weapons! Axes and hammers are their fortes, but they’ll make a sword for a tall-folk if they’re very deferential. These are the gleaming weapons that cut dragonscale through pure, mundane craft. Sure, they can be enchanted, but wouldn’t that take the sport out of it all? They’ve definitely got one apocalypse ax in the vaults, they don’t mention it.","dwarf siegeworkers! They’ve built unmatched defenses, countless stone and earthworks, walls and murderholes and more! Problem is, they don’t know exactly how much they’ve built. Not that it stops them from building even more. Most invaders get so lost in the siegeworks they starve before ever seeing a dwarf.","the ancestors! Who needs gods when you’ve got countless thousands of dead relatives to judge your every action, and they’re never happy about it. Certainly, there may be less obtrusive faiths to follow, but this tends to keep all the dwarves very focused on the hold. Hard to leave when every generation has a hundred jobs a day for you.","a dwarven queen!? That’s right, you thought we were just going to have another king, but joke’s on you! She’s every inch the leader her male counterparts are, but she had to make it in a world that never believed in her! Strong, capable, and somber as any king, she wonders if there is any way to protect her people. Yeah, she can be dour too!","they’ve built a secret forge, one that yields creations that rivals that of the gods. Problem is, they may have used divine tools in it, ones that have been missing for millenia. They were going to bring them back, they swear! But they have to find the right time to do it, imagine if other dwarves were to find out!","an evil wizard has been poisoning the aquifers! They’ve set themselves up on top of the nearest mountain. The runoff from the experiments keeps getting into the streams, which poisons the forests, but more importantly it gets into the aquifers! The dwarves have sent envoys, but the wizard hasn’t even received them! Dwarven vigilante gangs have been ambushing the apprentices, and the conflict is getting ever more violent. The wizard is clearly doing something bad, otherwise the runoff wouldn’t be so foul. The dwarves need this problem solved, though the wizard may pay better.","the crypts are opening, and the dead walk! The ancestors are walking and attacking the living, it’s mucking everything up! Productivity is down! Also dwarves are being eaten by their noble forebearers! It’s a bad situation, but the dwarves can’t do anything to the walking dead. After all, that would be disrespectful to the ancestors! They’ll need someone to help!"
"bone dwarves! Dwarves with exceptional bones, those with histories of necromancy and morticianship. These dwarves are always back-facing, prioritizing ancestor worship. Their bones grow out of their bodies, offering dense, calcified segments of their skin. Immensely proud, they tend to be regressive culturally, and their young often leave to find adventure and new experience, chafing under their elder’s direction.","under a big lake! What, you think dwarves don’t like water? Dwarves practically made water, they hit all the ice soft. This dwarfhold is protected by the lake itself, a giant stone hold built into the lake bed. Mostly they get out through tunnels and gas filled bladders that float to the surface. These dwarves get wet.","guns! And cannons too, these are powder dwarves. Others of their ilk may hold their nose, but they even use the stuff to mine, blasting chunks out of the earth to find more precious salpeter. Merchants and kings are always sending envoys to purchase these, and sometimes they even sell them. 1d6 are making a gun to kill gods. It’s going fine.","dwarven cavalry! These dwarves ride horses, like tall-folk! They have to ride in enhanced saddles, and wield halberds as axes, and the horses hate it. These dwarves are far too dense and strangely proportioned to ride normally, and they’re often falling off the horses. Still, they move much faster than other dwarves, which is always a surprise.","the earth itself! And not the surface earth, like all those druid circles, but the real earth, the stone and rock and ore that holds it all up. It’s not an abstract concept, like all those odd philosophers say, it’s real. It’s under your feed, the target of the mining hammers. If that’s not god, then what the hell could be? The sky? What are you, a moron?","a council of thanes! Dwarven nobles, noble in name and noble in deed, so noble they make tall-folk kings look like common gutter types. These thanes can trace their ancestry back to the beginning, and they will tell you every part of it. Mostly they operate by committee, who cares if they’ve got feuds from seventy generations past?","an infestation of giant insects, Oreater Bugs. They’ve taken the lower mines, and they keep feeding on the crystalline calories. The dwarves have been trying to get them out, but the bugs are durable and dangerous. Sure they’re not making any aggressive actions themselves, and maybe they can talk, but who’s got time for that! Gotta mine!","orcs have moved into the valley! A confederation of migratory tribes, this is outside of their historic migration patterns, and what’s most troubling is that they’ve started constructing permanent structures. There’s old, bad blood between the dwarf hold and orcs as a whole, with the ancient, mythic struggle between the two peoples keenly remembered by the dwarf-hold (though the orcs seem to have no recollection, how dare they!). The conflict has become violent enough that the nearby human count has been entreated as a negotiator and peacekeeper. However, tensions are high as negotiations continue, further exacerbated by an academic expedition that claims to have evidence of orcish settlements predating the hold. They are expected to present their findings soon.","a dwarven marriage is happening! Normally this would be a good thing, but the betrothed are from two of the most powerful dwarven families in the hold, and they’ve got old, old hatred for one another. This tale of star-crossed lovers would be nice somewhere else, but the hold is about to break out into a civil war, with blood debts being called in between the different families. The marriage ceremony is two weeks away, and there have already been casualties! Maybe, just this once, love should lose!"
"mushroom dwarves! Dwarves that farmed the myriad mushrooms of the underground caverns, they have lichens and fungi growing in many parts of their body. This seems to be a symbiotic relationship, and the dwarves are able to communicate with one another via spores. They tend to be most understood by non-dwarves and those who do not prioritize non-verbal communication.","under that human city! They don’t even know they’re down there, or if they do they don’t talk about it, typical humans.This hold barely interacts with those above, and they’re heavily defended against all intruders. Sometimes young dwarves will strike out into the sewers, but only the maddest go surfaceside.","statues! These are sculptor dwarves, cutting shapes from the living stone so perfect that many think they’re moving. Most of them can, they just prefer to stay still. Whenever threatened, it’s these statues that surge to life, beating the enemies of the hold to death. When they’re sold, the dwarves can use them as spies, a useful secondary income.","dwarven dragons! Not dwarves who are dragons, but these dwarves have tamed and reared blind, wingless dragons. They like the dwarves, but they like the mushrooms and fermented ale the dwarves make more. This makes their breath entirely poisonous, but real dwarves don’t care about poison, and these. Are. Real. Dwarves. ","the dwarven king! No, not the one sitting on the throne right now, but the King Under the Mountain, the dwarf who led the dwarves in their darkest hour! He disappeared, betrayed by the cursed surface dwarves. Now the faithful await for an even darker hour when the king will return! They’re sure he was just busy for all those other dark hours.","a dwarven merchant caste! They learned a long time ago that tall-folk wanted what they made, and so they organized their entire government around the almighty profit-margin. The dwarven trading companies have charters with most major polities nearby, and they only occasionally declare intra-hold war with one another. Ideal.","these dwarves lost their ancient runes! They’re not really sure how, but they think someone took them. Probably one of the elves, or the tall-folk merchants, or a secret cabal, but couldn’t be the dwarves, who definitely didn’t misplace them. Of course, they can’t write new texts, so these dwarves work hard to hide the sudden illiteracy.","mushrooms are growing out of control! The nutrient rich mushrooms grown by dwarves underground have reached the surface, and they are overtaking the native flora and fauna. Dwarven burn teams have been sent out, but they’re not only getting sunsick themselves, but the flames are at best a stalling tactic. The spores are simply spreading too quickly, and they’ve begun infecting the local fauna. Entire villages have been lost, their occupants gripped by this infection, and there are some dwarven sages who fear this access to such nutrient and neural networks will lead to a great hive mind. They’ve sent for aid, but their efforts are further being confounded by spore druids who preach apocalyptic visions. ","dwarven gladiatorial combat has become far too popular! Most of the locals are entranced by it, to the point where it’s distracting from their duties. There are also, maybe, a lot of young dwarves being killed and maimed. It’s a bad situation! No one’s sure how things got so far out of hand, but that strange ruby that was unearthed certainly doesn’t seem to be helping."
"mole dwarves! Dwarves that were raised by moles long ago, they are the greatest diggers among their peoples. Their beards allow them tremorsense, and their fingers have exceptionally developed nails for digging. These dwarves tend to have more pronounced noses, that gives them the look of a mole. ","in a pyramid! Or maybe it’s a ziggurat, they’re dwarves, not archaeologists! Used to be there were a bunch of cloth wrapped types in here, but they all got chopped up and put into cast iron jars. They still rumble around in there, but who really cares. These dwarves have adopted similar garb to the original dwellers, and they love hieroglyphics.","gold! Yeah, you knew these were coming. Most dwarves are embarrassed by them, but as the old dwarven adage goes, “they hate us cause they ain’t us.” These dwarves struck it big with the richest vein of gold in the world, and they flaunt it. Not much use in a fight, but they have standing contracts with a dozen mercenary companies.","thirteen strong dwarves! This companionship of dwarves have been on many adventures together, and they were responsible for getting rid of a nasty dragon years ago. They’re always getting in over their heads, but they end up out top! They say there’s a halfling and a wizard who helps them, but no one’s seen them!","the mother goddess! That’s right patriarchs, these dwarves know to always listen to their mother, especially the earth, the biggest mother of all! These dwarves have a real Ancient Mesopotamian aura, and they claim to be the first religion of all dwarves. Others disagree, but what do they know anyway! They worship something dumb, like rocks!","the gerontocracy! The oldest dwarves rule the hold, what with their repository of wisdom and knowledge. They’re so wise, look at those beards! Those wizened stares! Their brains are functional, absolutely, why do you ask? Some say the greatest leaders just pretend to be old, but that would undermine the whole system!","these dwarves are learning wizard magick! Not proper dwarven magick, runes and forges and the like, but tall-folk book magick! Very undwarf-like, but it’s become all the rage in the hold. Of course, they can’t let other dwarves know, but these young dwarves keep running around in the damn hats! ","giant wasps are plaguing the dwarfhold! They’re big, feathered, and mad as hell at anyone who gets near them. They’re reproducing in titanic nests, and their stingers can pierce all but the thickest armor. Some of the local villages have evacuated, but those nearest to the dwarf-hold found themselves caught between the dwarves and the wasps. They’ve requested sanctuary, and (somehow), the dwarven leadership granted them permission to build refugee camps outside the entrance. Some dwarves even help them build defenses, but the wasps have already started reaching the camps. Tensions have risen as the refugees see the hold interior as their only safe haven, but they’re not welcome as they aren’t dwarves at all! ","a coup is occurring! An actual coup, like the tall-folk do every few years. This just doesn’t happen to dwarves, and a large number of the population is in denial, despite the open fighting in the streets and halls of government. They keep shushing the concerns of the dwarves who are watching the coup happen, at times getting physically combative. Hopefully this will all sort itself out, but the coupers seem unsure how to actually finish carrying out the coup."
"mole dwarves! Dwarves that were raised by moles long ago, they are the greatest diggers among their peoples. Their beards allow them tremorsense, and their fingers have exceptionally developed nails for digging. These dwarves tend to have more pronounced noses, that gives them the look of a mole. ","in a big skeleton! Damn this thing is big, the ribs alone are taller than most human keeps. Really makes you wonder about the relative smallness in the scope of the unknown. Not that these dwarves care! They’ve been digging up this skeleton for generations, filling in gaps for protection. It’s going pretty well!","steel! These are dwarf-prols, real blue collar types, and they’re the greatest steelworkers in the world. Heavily unionized, they often clash with leadership, and their strikes are a thing to behold. But if you want steel, these are the blokes. Just send the specs and they’ll make it happen, don’t you worry. Just remember, union strong.","dwarven wizards! Wizards typically aren’t dwarves, but these are, and they may be awful at it, no one can tell. They keep yelling spells when they cast them, but it seems that most of them just yell the name and do the action. Still, they’ve got the hats, and when thirty dwarves yell “HOLD PERSON” and grapple you, it’s hard to get free.","the pursuit of the impeccable craft! This is as civic as a religion gets, and honestly most other dwarves are a little weirded out by it. Seems like a cult. But to hell with them! These are dwarves who pursue their craft, beautifully, perfectly, with each striving to achieve an ideal. And so what if they go a little mad in the pursuit? That’s religion for ya!","theocracy! These dwarves elevated the religious head to political leadership, and it’s gone great! Are there more holy wars, certainly, why wouldn’t there be? These are good wars, that’s why they put the holy dwarves in charge, so they’d know the decisions were always right. What are you, one of those king dwarves? Get outta here!","they’re friends with elves! Horrible business, and the elves are just as embarrassed, but these two communities have fought alongside one another since their foundings. There are even elf-dwarf marriages! Of course, it could be better if they just admitted it, but how undwarf-like would that be! Better to repress it and not bring it up.","a mysterious man has arrived in the region! He wears only dark clothes stained red, and has been whipping up a frenzy among the townsfolk outside the hold. They seem to think the dwarves have great wealth (which they do, of course, they’re dwarves), but these outsiders think it belongs to them! The dwarves have closed the hold, which has only confirmed the suspicions of the townsfolk. They keep forming mobs and trying to get into the hold through alternate routes, all while the mysterious man keeps vanishing with a group of well-paid mercenaries whenever things get too heated. Just what is he up to, and why does he want all eyes turned towards this conflict?","the dwarf-home is flooding! Something happened to break the nearby body of water into the tunnel-mine system of the dwarf-hold. This has generally been considered a bad thing, and the dwarves are trying to build whatever dams and stop-gaps they can, but the water keeps rising. The tunnels are extensive enough that the surface is starting to entirely drain, causing drought, and worse than all that is some of the dwarves swear something is swimming down here."
"tall dwarves! Very tall for a dwarf! Clocking in at 5’, these dwarves tend to live on mountaintops, under the open sky. Odd for dwarves, they don’t much care for being underground. These dwarves include those who have parentage with taller folk, which is often given as the reason for the undwarflike behavior.","on a mesa! You know, the tall, flat top parts of the world! It’s big, it’s tall, and it’s very easily defended. The dwarves there started carving the sides of it so anyone climbing it has to go up at a degree even steeper than 90 degrees. The top is actually nice, springs and herd animals on top, a real natural fortress for the dwarves burrowing beneath.","gems! These dwarves mine and cut gems, and all the wizards want ‘em! Wizard colleges, sorcerer cults, and religious temples all send their representatives to this dwarf hold to negotiate for spell components, and they often get into scraps with one another. The dwarves don’t mind, so long as they keep it in the Diplomacy Ward.","the world’s biggest dwarf! This guy is huge, big enough that no one can really stop him. Spells don’t work on him (he counts as more than one creature), and he can pick up almost anything. Most armies tend to turn around when the world’s biggest dwarf starts chucking hills at them. This guy loves eggs!","the shaping dwarf! Some think they’re similar to the god of the forge, but they couldn’t be more wrong. This is the shaping dwarf, the first dwarf, the one who molded the living rock as clay to make their fellows. This is a dwarf of the dwarves, one who really gets it, you know? No afterlife, no gods, but dwarves helping dwarves!","craftocracy! If you build it, you can rule! Every year the best craftsdwarves are judged by the people, and whoever has achieved the highest level of excellence is the leader for the next year. You’re saying the dwarf who carved the most perfect statue isn’t suited to negotiate water rights? Sounds like you need to take a civics class!","these dwarves have outsourced their mining! Employing a legion of kobold laborers, these dwarves have grown allegedly quite lazy. Of course, they instead pursue other things, including craft and trade and art and philosophy, but they’re not even in the mines! And there are a lot of kobolds! Seems like a recipe for a bad time.","a series of prophetic events have occurred in the region near the dwarf-hold! This prophecy-chain has been creeping ever-closer to the hold, and a dwarven recorder has found old hieroglyphics that may predate the dwarves of the hold themself. Probably nothing to be worried about, the leaders of the hold certainly aren’t, but the events are becoming increasingly destructive as they get closer!","they built it at last! The final craft, the perfect object has been made in the hold. It is utterly without flaw, and brings dwarves to weeping upon the mere sight of it. The entire hold has stopped, unsure of how to proceed. Any non-dwarf who looks upon it must save against the number of dwarves nearby or understand their viewpoint. The dwarves are unsure how to proceed, but will certainly hold this masterwork as a relic forever!"
"meat dwarves! A “regular” dwarf! These are the dwarves who tend to spend the most time on the surface, and they are seen as odd by their fellows. They tend towards restlessness, exploring the wide swathes of the world, and some have not seen the dwarf-holds in generations.","in a volcano! These aren’t like paltry MOUNTAIN dwarves, no these dwarves built their hold in a hot place! For lava! They love lava, these dwarves, and magma. Don’t ask them to know which is which. If you were a dwarf, you’d know. Besides, now they never have to heat the forges! Sure hope they don’t dig too deep!","nothing! The lazy bums! They don’t seem interested in turning their entire hold to the sole production of a single good! Other dwarf-holds don’t trust ‘em the weird little shits. What are they, too good to work? Sure they work, but they don’t have one thing they fixate on. It’s unnatural! Or at least, un-dwarflike!","the prince of the dwarves! He’s the handsomest of all dwarves (average to all others), and his immense charisma causes dwarves of all stripes to flock to his cause. Always pledging to reclaim this ancient home or that. Mostly he just drinks and rallies the lads and avoids the actual fighting, like any proper prince.","the apocalypse maw! This is some dark shit! The maw of the world, that which will yawn ever wider and consume all! These dwarves believe some fucked up things! Sure they’re not all bad in the day to day, but like your more condescending evangelical friend, you know that they think you’re going to hell! Which is not the maw! Weird!","anarcho-collectivism! These dwarves do everything by agreement, bonding with one another through collective work and coming to an agreeable approach. Sure it takes longer, but every dwarf have a voice and a choice, and what’s best for everyone is best for every one! They are all card-carrying teamsters.","the dwarves aren’t dwarves! They’re very good at hiding it behind beards and clothing, but they’re halflings, or goblins or something. Sure they act like dwarves, and engage with culture as dwarves, but that just cheapens it for real dwarves!! (roll 1d6, 1-halflings, 2-gnomes, 3-goblins, 4-kobolds, 5-short humans, 6-confused dwarves)","dragons are here! Well, just the one dragon, but it’s here and it’s parked right outside of the dwarf-hold! It brought with it members of its “family” (probably cultists or kobolds, can’t tell which is worse). The dragon seems chuffed about something, and it keeps burning any dwarves who try to leave or kill it. Inside, the dwarves are starting to build siege engines to try and shoot the damn thing, but the “family” keeps blocking off secret exits. Strange thing is, the dragon lets anyone into the hold, but no one out. ","a great battle within the dwarf-hold! Same as result 7, however things went a bit worse. This creation was perfect, but rather than inspiring awe, it inspires a covetous greed in all dwarves nearby. The craft is somewhere in the hold (it can’t leave), but dwarves have been killing each other for weeks trying to get it. Alliances form and fracture in hours, and the hold is awash in damage and blood. 40% chance the craft is sentient and is influencing the dwarves, 60% chance it’s just an excellent craft."
,,,,,,,"shiftless hill dwarves have moved into the region! No one’s really sure why they all showed up, but it’s very embarrassing. Of course, they are dwarves, no one’s denying that, but they’re giving the entire hold a bad reputation! They only work as much as they need to in order to earn coin, and some of them aren’t even drinking! Word is their women don’t even have beards. The leadership has organized a committee to send instruction to these toplander cousins, but they were all beaten up! This insult needs answering, so outright war is being prepared for! The reputation must be saved!","dwarven criminals have taken the hold! Certainly the hold has its “rulers” but they’re just puppets for the dwarven mafia-state. Most of the younger dwarves have aligned themselves with one of these mafias, all in the hope that they’ll become a “made dwarf.” Older dwarves have largely given up trying to stop this trend, and every purchase needs a cut to go to one of the 1d6 mafia kingpins. If there is only 1 mafia kingpin, then either they have eliminated all rivals and new, lesser ones are plotting their demise, or they have utter mastery of the hold and are planning “expansions” into their neighbors."
,,,,,,,"goblins have started building their own hold! It’s ugly, big, and growing much faster than the dwarves. The dwarf hold is better, everyone can see it, but the goblin hold certainly is impressive, if all you want is a BIG hold. Mostly scrap and salvage, the goblins have even started sending emissaries to other local communities, offering trade and services! Worst of all, they’ve started wearing false beards! These goblins must be stopped, or else the wars of dwarf and goblin will begin anew!","the hold is having a crisis of faith! The religion was recently disproven by a traveling dwarven scholar-skeptic (a strange and off-putting group of dwarves who are mostly ignored), and now the hold doesn’t know how to proceed. This has broken down into groups of militant-atheists and those trying to “preserve the spirit of the faith.” Things have been growing violent, but the largest problem is that a dwarven child claims to have a “new friend” who is suspiciously like the disproved divine. The other dwarves can see this “friend” but pretend not to, as it would overly complicate things."
,,,,,,,"a strong goat has been causing chaos! At a glance, it’s not different from any other goat, but it’s bashed or gored all of the hold’s strongest dwarves! The protectors themselves can’t get involved, but the dwarves that were taken out were no slouches! This goat has offended the honor of the dwarves, and it needs to be brought to heel! Or hoof! It may be a holy goat, but it can’t be confirmed until it’s been caught, and so it must be captured alive!","the prince has returned! He has come with a group of companions, heroes all who have endured a great quest. The only problem is, the hold already has leaders, they’re the ones who resettled it after the last occupants were driven out. This princely line seems to have been traveling far, far off, finally returning to what they thought would be an enemy-occupied hold. Now things are very awkward, as no one is certain how the government should respond to two semi-legitimate rulers."
,,,,,,,"a great storm has struck the region! The dwarves are of course protected in the dwarf-hold, but the surrounding region (which they rely upon for certain raw goods and food) has been devastated! What’s worse, the storm seems to be still going. The dwarves are concerned that if the flooding continues, there’s a chance that the storm will flood the entire region! Something has to be done, and some dwarven scouts swear they’ve seen something in the eye of the storm, though whether it’s a ship, structure, or beast is up to some interpretation.","the hold dug too deep, but in the wrong way! Unlike traditional digging too deep (as all good mountain dwarves should do at least once), these dwarves sought to dig even deeper, and now they’ve unearthed something far worse. Roll 1d6 (1- dug a hole into hell, and the devil is equally confused, 2- dug a hole into time, where past and future bleed through, 3- dug a hole into the moon, now there’s moon stuff, 4- dug a hole into the concept of dwarves, risking infection of realspace, 5- dug a hole into the DARK BELOW, 6- dug a hole to the other side of the world, dwarves keep falling out into nothing!)"
